MULTI CLOUD ARCHITECTURE:

In this architecture, we will utilize AWS for certain services and Google Cloud for others. 
This design is geared towards leveraging the best features of both platforms while ensuring seamless communication, networking, and management between the two clouds.

High-Level Architecture Components:
Compute:
AWS: EC2 instances for hosting the application.
Google Cloud: Google Compute Engine or Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for running containerized services.
Storage:
AWS: S3 for object storage.
Google Cloud: Cloud Storage (GCS) for backup and disaster recovery.
Networking:

AWS: VPC and VPN Gateway for secure communication.
Google Cloud: VPC and Cloud VPN to connect the GCP network to the AWS network.
Identity & Access Management (IAM):

AWS IAM for AWS resources.
Google Cloud IAM for managing permissions and access on GCP.
Monitoring and Logging:

AWS CloudWatch for monitoring AWS resources.
Google Cloud Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver) for monitoring GCP resources.
Load Balancing:

AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) for distributing traffic to EC2 instances.
Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) for GCP-based resources.
Step-by-Step Design with Code Examples:
Below is a multi-cloud architecture using Terraform for provisioning both AWS and Google Cloud resources, with a focus on interoperability between the two clouds.

Step 1: Terraform Provider Setup
In the main.tf file, configure the AWS and Google Cloud providers.

hcl
Copy code
# Configure AWS provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"  # AWS region
}

# Configure Google Cloud provider
provider "google" {
  project = "your-gcp-project-id"  # GCP Project ID
  region  = "us-central1"  # GCP Region
}
Step 2: VPC Setup for Both Clouds
We need to create VPCs in both AWS and GCP so that resources in each cloud can communicate with each other.

AWS VPC Setup:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_vpc" "aws_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  tags = {
    Name = "aws_vpc"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "aws_subnet" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.aws_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-west-2a"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "aws_subnet"
  }
}
Google Cloud VPC Setup:
hcl
Copy code
resource "google_compute_network" "gcp_network" {
  name = "gcp_network"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
}

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "gcp_subnetwork" {
  name          = "gcp_subnetwork"
  region        = "us-central1"
  network       = google_compute_network.gcp_network.name
  ip_cidr_range = "10.0.2.0/24"
}
Step 3: Compute Resources in Both Clouds
AWS EC2 Instance:
Weâ€™ll create an EC2 instance to host a web application.

hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_instance" "aws_instance" {
  ami = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Replace with the latest Amazon Linux AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id = aws_subnet.aws_subnet.id
  tags = {
    Name = "AWS Instance"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              yum update -y
              yum install -y httpd
              systemctl start httpd
              systemctl enable httpd
              echo "<html><body><h1>Hello from AWS</h1></body></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html
              EOF
}
Google Cloud Compute Engine Instance:
A GCP instance will run the second part of the application or services.

hcl
Copy code
resource "google_compute_instance" "gcp_instance" {
  name         = "gcp-instance"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"
  zone         = "us-central1-a"
  tags         = ["gcp-instance"]

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-10-buster-v20210316"
    }
  }

  network_interface {
    network = google_compute_network.gcp_network.name
    subnetwork = google_compute_subnetwork.gcp_subnetwork.name
    access_config {}
  }

  metadata_startup_script = <<-EOT
    #!/bin/bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y apache2
    echo "<html><body><h1>Hello from Google Cloud</h1></body></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    systemctl restart apache2
  EOT
}
Step 4: Set Up Networking (VPC Peering or VPN)
In a multi-cloud architecture, communication between clouds is key. We can use a VPN or VPC Peering for this. Here, we'll simulate VPN Gateway setup between AWS and GCP.

AWS VPN Gateway Setup:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_vpn_gateway" "aws_vpn_gateway" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.aws_vpc.id
  tags = {
    Name = "AWS VPN Gateway"
  }
}
Google Cloud VPN Gateway Setup:
hcl
Copy code
resource "google_compute_vpn_gateway" "gcp_vpn_gateway" {
  name    = "gcp-vpn-gateway"
  network = google_compute_network.gcp_network.name
  region  = "us-central1"
}
Step 5: Set Up S3 and Google Cloud Storage for Data Sharing
We will create an S3 bucket in AWS and a Google Cloud Storage bucket in GCP for storing and sharing data.

AWS S3 Bucket:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "aws_s3" {
  bucket = "my-aws-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}
Google Cloud Storage Bucket:
hcl
Copy code
resource "google_storage_bucket" "gcp_bucket" {
  name     = "my-gcp-bucket"
  location = "US"
  storage_class = "STANDARD"
}
Step 6: Load Balancer Setup (Optional)
We can configure load balancing to manage traffic across AWS and GCP. Below is a simplified configuration for each platform:

AWS Load Balancer (Elastic Load Balancer - ELB):
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_lb" "aws_lb" {
  name               = "aws-load-balancer"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.lb_sg.id]
  subnets            = [aws_subnet.aws_subnet.id]

  enable_deletion_protection = false
  enable_cross_zone_load_balancing = true
}
Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB):
hcl
Copy code
resource "google_compute_global_address" "gclb_address" {
  name = "gclb-address"
}

resource "google_compute_backend_service" "gclb_backend" {
  name = "gclb-backend-service"
  backends {
    group = google_compute_instance_group.gcp_instance_group.self_link
  }
  health_checks = [google_compute_http_health_check.gclb_health_check.id]
}
Step 7: Apply Terraform Configuration
Once all resources are defined, initialize and apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure:

bash
Copy code
# Initialize the configuration
terraform init

# Preview the infrastructure plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration to create the resources
terraform apply
Step 8: 
"Interoperability and Testing":
Verify Interoperability:
Test VPC peering/VPN between AWS and GCP by pinging instances from both clouds.
Verify data synchronization between AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.
Verify monitoring across both clouds (AWS CloudWatch and Google Cloud Operations Suite).

Testing the Application:
Open the EC2 instance public IP in a browser to view the "Hello from AWS" page.
Open the Google Compute Engine instance public IP in a browser to view the "Hello from Google Cloud" page.

Traffic Load Balancing:
Access your application via the Load Balancer URL, ensuring traffic is distributed properly across both AWS and GCP resources.

Documentation Deliverables:
Architecture Diagram: A diagram showing how the services are distributed between AWS and Google Cloud.
Terraform Code: All configuration files for provisioning the infrastructure across both clouds.
Deployment Steps: A step-by-step guide on how to set up the infrastructure, including configuration files and testing instructions.
Interoperability Details: Documentation on how the services in AWS and Google Cloud interact, such as through VPN, VPC peering, and data synchronization.

Conclusion:

This multi-cloud architecture takes advantage of AWS and Google Cloud by distributing resources across both platforms for scalability, fault tolerance, and cost optimization.
The interoperability is ensured by utilizing VPC Peering/VPN, cross-cloud monitoring, and data synchronization. 
Using Terraform to provision resources ensures that this architecture can be easily reproduced and managed.

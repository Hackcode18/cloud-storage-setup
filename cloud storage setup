To create and configure cloud storage on either AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, you need to follow a series of steps to set up the storage bucket, upload example files, and configure appropriate access permissions.

-----AWS S3 Setup-----

Step 1:
"Create an S3 Bucket":
1. "Sign in" to your [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Navigate to "S3" by searching for "S3" in the search bar.
3. Click on "Create Bucket".
4. Provide a "unique name" for your bucket. Bucket names must be globally unique.
5. Select the "region" for your bucket (it’s typically best to choose the region closest to your users).
6. Configure "options" (you can leave these as default for now).
7. Set permissions:
   - Uncheck "Block all public access" if you want to make the bucket publicly accessible. You can choose specific permissions later.
8. Click "Create".

Step 2: 
"Upload Files to S3 Bucket":
1. Click on the newly created bucket in the S3 console.
2. Click on the "upload" button.
3. Choose the files you want to upload (you can drag and drop multiple files).
4. Click "Upload".

Step 3: 
"Configure Access Permissions":
1. After uploading, go to the "Permissions" tab of the file.
2. To make files publicly accessible (for example, if you want to share an image), click "Edit" under the permissions section.
3. Grant "Read access" for "Everyone (public access)".
4. Click "Save changes".

Step 4: "Set Bucket Policy (Optional)":
To control access at a more granular level, you can set a **bucket policy**. For example, to allow public access to all files in your bucket, use this policy:
-json

code:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}

Replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the name of your bucket.

step 5: 
"Test and Access Your Files":
- After configuring access, you can access your files using the URL format:  
  `https://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME.s3.amazonaws.com/your-file-name`

 ----Google Cloud Storage Setup---

Step 1: 
"Create a Google Cloud Storage Bucket":
1. 'Sign in' to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. In the left navigation panel, go to 'Cloud Storage' > 'Buckets'.
3. Click on the 'Create Bucket' button.
4. Choose a ''global name'' for your bucket (bucket names must be globally unique).
5. Choose the "location" for your bucket (multi-region, region, etc.).
6. Choose a "storage class" and ''access control'' (default or fine-grained access).
7. Click "Create".

Step 2: 
"Upload Files to the Bucket":
1. Click on the newly created bucket in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Click on the **Upload Files** button and select files to upload from your local machine.

Step 3:
"Configure Access Permissions":
1. To modify access permissions for your files, go to the **Permissions** tab of the file or bucket.
2. Click **Add** to add new permissions.
3. Grant users or groups the necessary access levels. For public access to a file, you can use **IAM** permissions or set the "Object ACLs".

Step 4: 
"Set Bucket Policy (Optional)":
You can create a "Bucket Policy" in the Google Cloud Console using IAM roles and permissions, but if you just want to allow public access to all objects, you can use "Object ACLs":
1. Go to the "Permissions" tab of the bucket.
2. Click "Add members" and use the "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers" roles.
3. For "public read access", grant the "Storage Object Viewer" role.

 Step 5: 
"Access Your Files"
- After setting permissions, you can access your files via the URL:  
'https://storage.googleapis.com/YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/your-file-name`

Example Files and Testing:
After uploading your example files (e.g., an image or a text file), you can try accessing them using the generated URL. If you’ve configured public access, you should be able to view/download the file directly from the web.
For example, if you uploaded a file named `sample-image.jpg` to AWS S3, the URL would be:  
`https://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME.s3.amazonaws.com/sample-image.jpg`

Summary of Permissions:
Public Access: Use IAM roles or ACLs to grant public access (read or full).
Private Access: By default, storage buckets are private, and you need to explicitly grant access.
